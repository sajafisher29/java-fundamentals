# Java Fundamentals

This repo contains the Java Fundamentals work for Java 401

## Problem Domain

Lab 1) This lab is dedicated to practicing Java fundamentals. These problems will challenge your understanding of Java’s built-in primitive values (ints, floats, doubles, booleans), Strings, for loops, while loops, if statements, functions, parameters and return statements.
2) This lab is dedicated to creating, interacting with and manipulating arrays in Java. Arrays in Java have a fixed size. Arrays are created with a certain size and they never shrink or grow. Java arrays are typed. You can have an array of integers, or an array of strings, but not an array mixed with integers and strings.
